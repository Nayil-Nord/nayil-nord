# Hi, I’m Nayil (Наиль)! 👋

I’m glad to see you on my GitHub.
Not long ago, I decided to master **Data Analysis**. To achieve this ambitious goal, I need a deep understanding of mathematics (including algebra), statistics, Python (including libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn), and SQL. 

I am a **robotics engineer**. I enjoy programming with Arduino and ESP32, which I'm also learning. I’m passionate about robotics startups.

I am a **technological artist** and a master’s student in **Technological Art** at NITU MISIS.
