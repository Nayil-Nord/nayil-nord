# Hi, Iâ€™m Nail! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m glad to see you on my GitHub.
Not long ago, I decided to master **Data Analysis**. To achieve this ambitious goal, I need a deep understanding of mathematics (including algebra), statistics, Python (including libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn), and SQL. I am currently studying all of this with SENATOROVAI.

I am a lead design engineer and a **robotics engineer**. I enjoy programming with Arduino and ESP32, which I'm also learning. Iâ€™m passionate about robotics startups.

In addition, I am a technological artist and a masterâ€™s student in **Technological Art** at NITU MISIS.
